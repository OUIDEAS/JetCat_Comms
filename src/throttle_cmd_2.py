Created by Colton Wright on 1/8/2023

Log all the data from the JetCat PRO_Interface, while also sending throttle
commands to control the RPM of the engine. No live serial plotting. This 
program will save the times as a better format and calculate everything
before starting the engine. Should also work as throttle percent or
throttle RPM in the same program.

FFI is required to send CRC16 to the PRO-Interface. You need the c .o files
compiled in order to run this program.
